# MachineToFrameworkAdapter — coif-component recommended sync
#
# SUPERSEDED by adapter-pipeline.sync in coif-render.
#
# Previously this sync routed Machine/connect props to
# FrameworkAdapter/normalize directly. Now the adapter pipeline
# in coif-render handles this: per-framework adapter concepts
# (ReactAdapter, SolidAdapter, etc.) each have their own sync
# rule that fires on Machine/connect, routing to the correct
# adapter based on the active framework.
#
# This file is retained for documentation — the actual routing
# lives in coif-render/syncs/adapter-pipeline.sync.
