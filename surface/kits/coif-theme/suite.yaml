    Visual design system: themes, palettes, typography, motion,
    and elevation. Concept structures are unchanged but inputs
    now come from ThemeParser output rather than imperative calls.
    Palette/generate, Typography scale computation, and Motion
    reduced-motion handling are resolved at parse time; runtime
    concepts store the resolved values (color maps, sizes, etc.)
    with WCAG accessibility enforcement.

concepts:
  Theme:
    spec: ./theme.concept
    params:
      H: { as: theme-ref, description: "Reference to a theme" }

  Palette:
    spec: ./palette.concept
    params:
      C: { as: palette-ref, description: "Reference to a color palette" }

  Typography:
    spec: ./typography.concept
    params:
      X: { as: typography-ref, description: "Reference to a typography definition" }

  Motion:
    spec: ./motion.concept
    params:
      O: { as: motion-ref, description: "Reference to a motion/animation definition" }

  Elevation:
    spec: ./elevation.concept
    params:
      W: { as: elevation-ref, description: "Reference to an elevation/shadow level" }

syncs:
  required:
    - path: ./syncs/theme-activate-tokens.sync
      name: ThemeActivateTokens
      description: >
        When a theme is activated, resolve all tokens to produce
        the complete token map.

    - path: ./syncs/theme-tokens-to-signals.sync
      name: ThemeTokensToSignals
      description: >
        When tokens are resolved, batch-update signals for live
        theme switching.

  recommended:
    - path: ./syncs/palette-to-tokens.sync
      name: PaletteToTokens
      description: >
        When a palette generates a color scale, register each
        shade as a primitive design token.

    - path: ./syncs/contrast-warning.sync
      name: ContrastWarning
      description: >
        When a palette is assigned a semantic role, auto-check
        WCAG contrast against the surface palette.

  - name: light
