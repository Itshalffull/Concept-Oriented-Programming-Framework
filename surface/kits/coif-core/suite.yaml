    Foundation concepts for COIF: design tokens, abstract elements,
    UI schemas, concept bindings, and reactive signals. Required by
    all other COIF kits. Inspection pipeline: inspect → classify
    interaction types → apply defaults → apply overrides → produce
    element tree.

concepts:
  DesignToken:
    spec: ./design-token.concept
    params:
      T: { as: token-ref, description: "Reference to a design token" }

  Element:
    spec: ./element.concept
    params:
      E: { as: element-ref, description: "Reference to an abstract interaction element" }

  UISchema:
    spec: ./ui-schema.concept
    params:
      S: { as: schema-ref, description: "Reference to a UI schema instance" }
      C: { as: concept-ref, description: "Reference to the source COPF concept" }

  Binding:
    spec: ./binding.concept
    params:
      B: { as: binding-ref, description: "Reference to a surface binding" }
      C: { as: concept-ref, description: "Reference to the bound COPF concept" }

  Signal:
    spec: ./signal.concept
    params:
      G: { as: signal-ref, description: "Reference to a reactive signal" }

syncs:
  required:
    - path: ./syncs/inspect-and-generate.sync
      name: InspectAndGenerate
      description: >
        When a binding is created, auto-generate UI schema from
        the bound concept spec. Entry point for the COIF pipeline.

    - path: ./syncs/concept-state-to-signal.sync
      name: ConceptStateToSignal
      description: >
        When a binding syncs from backend, batch-update all mapped
        signals. Backend → UI direction of the reactive loop.

    - path: ./syncs/binding-state-sync.sync
      name: BindingStateSync
      description: >
        When a signal is written (user input), sync back to the
        bound concept. UI → backend direction of the reactive loop.

  recommended:
    - path: ./syncs/schema-to-elements.sync
      name: UISchemaToElements
      description: >
        When a UI schema is generated, extract abstract element tree
        for consumption by the Widget concept.
