suite:
  name: score-auto
  version: 0.1.0
  description: >
    Automatic Score integration for Clef apps. Provides a unified
    ScoreApi facade over the five Score suites (parse, symbol, semantic,
    analysis, discovery) and auto-registers Score as a built-in
    concept in every Clef runtime. Includes pre-built interface
    manifests for GraphQL, MCP, Claude Skills, and OpenAI function
    calling — all optimized for LLM consumption.

concepts:
  ScoreApi:
    spec: ./score-api.concept
    params:
      Q: { as: query-id, description: "Score query identifier" }

  ScoreIndex:
    spec: ./score-index.concept
    params:
      X: { as: index-id, description: "Score index identifier" }

syncs:
  required:
    - path: ./syncs/auto-register.sync
      name: ScoreAutoRegisterSync
      description: >
        Automatically register all Score suites when a Clef app
        boots. Fires on Registry/register completion for any
        concept, ensuring Score is available before user concepts
        begin executing.

    - path: ./syncs/index-on-parse.sync
      name: ScoreIndexOnParseSync
      description: >
        Maintain Score indexes when files are parsed. Feeds
        semantic entities into the ScoreIndex for LLM queries.

  recommended:
    - path: ./syncs/score-on-generate.sync
      name: ScoreOnGenerateSync
      description: >
        Update Score semantic graph when code generation runs.
        Tracks provenance from specs to generated artifacts.

    - path: ./syncs/score-on-deploy.sync
      name: ScoreOnDeploySync
      description: >
        Record deployment topology in Score's semantic layer.
        Enables runtime-aware queries about where concepts run.
