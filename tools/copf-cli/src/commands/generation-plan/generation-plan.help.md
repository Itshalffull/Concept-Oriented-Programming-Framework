# copf generation-plan — Help

View generation run tracking for **<source>** with step-by-step status, aggregate summaries, and run history.


> **When to use:** Use when checking the status of a generation run, viewing run summaries, or browsing generation history.


## Design Principles

- **Passive Observer:** GenerationPlan is purely passive — it records what syncs report, never drives execution.
- **Run Isolation:** Each generation run has its own reference. Steps are recorded against the active run.
**status:**
- [ ] Run reference is valid?

**summary:**
- [ ] All steps accounted for?

**history:**
- [ ] Limit is reasonable?
