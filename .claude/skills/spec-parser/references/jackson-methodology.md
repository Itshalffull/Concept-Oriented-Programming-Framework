# Jackson's Concept Design Methodology

Summary of Daniel Jackson's software concept design methodology
as applied in Clef.

## Five Core Principles

### 1. Singularity
Each concept serves exactly one purpose. If the purpose statement
contains "and", it should be split into separate concepts.

### 2. Independence
A concept never references another concept directly — no imports,
no shared types, no cross-concept calls. Concepts communicate only
through type parameters and syncs.

### 3. Sufficiency
The concept's state and actions are sufficient to fulfill its purpose.
Every use case implied by the purpose can be served by the declared actions.

### 4. Necessity
Every piece of state is needed by at least one action. Every action
serves the concept's purpose. No dead state or unused actions.

### 5. Invariant Completeness
Key properties of the concept are captured as formal invariants.
Invariants document what must always be true after each action completes.

## Design Workflow

1. **Articulate purpose** — Write 1-3 sentences describing what the
   concept is for, not how it works.
2. **Design state** — Start with the primary collection (`items: set T`),
   then add relations that serve the actions.
3. **Design actions** — Define verbs with typed parameters and return
   variants. Each variant represents a distinct outcome.
4. **Write invariants** — For each action+variant, state what must be
   true afterward. This catches design gaps early.
5. **Validate** — Run `clef check` to verify syntax, completeness, and
   consistency.

## Common Concept Patterns

| Pattern | State Shape | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Entity CRUD | `items: set T; fields: T -> Type` | User, Article |
| Relationship | `links: set L; from: L -> A; to: L -> B` | Friendship, Membership |
| Workflow | `items: set T; status: T -> Status` | Order, Approval |
| Guard | `(no primary state)` | Password, RateLimit |
