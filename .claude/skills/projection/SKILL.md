# Projection

Enrich ConceptManifests with interface generation metadata 
 Reads concept specs ( via ConceptManifest from SchemaGen ) and 
 interface annotations ( from app interface yaml ) , produces 
 generation ready projections with resource mappings , trait 
 bindings , cross concept type graphs , and opaque enrichment 
 content Enrichment is stored as a single JSON string 
 targets interpret keys they recognize ( workflows , 
 annotations , command tree , action mappings ) and ignore the 
 rest One projection per concept per generation run

## Commands

### project
Parse interface annotations Merge with ConceptManifest 
 Compute resource mappings from state relations and action 
 signatures Bind traits to actions Resolve cross concept 
 type references within the suite Enrichment data from 
 workflows , annotations , and target configs is serialized 
 as opaque JSON into the content field

**Arguments:** `$0` **manifest** (string), `$1` **annotations** (string)

### validate
All annotations resolve Resource mappings are consistent 
 No breaking changes from previous generation ( if history exists )

**Arguments:** `$0` **projection** (P)

### diff
Compare two projections Used for breaking change detection 
 and changelog generation

**Arguments:** `$0` **projection** (P), `$1` **previous** (P)

### inferResources
Auto derive REST resource mappings from state relations 
 and action signatures Actions named create add produce POST , 
 delete remove produce DELETE , list find produce GET , 
 update edit produce PUT Non CRUD actions produce POST 
 to resource { id } action name

**Arguments:** `$0` **projection** (P)
