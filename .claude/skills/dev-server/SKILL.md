# DevServer

Start a development server that watches concept specs and syncs for changes and auto-recompiles on save.


> **When to use:** Use when developing concepts and syncs iteratively. The dev server watches for file changes and recompiles automatically, providing a fast feedback loop.


## Design Principles

- **Watch and Recompile:** The dev server watches .concept and .sync files for changes and recompiles automatically — no manual rebuild step.
- **Fast Feedback Loop:** Recompilation should complete in under a second for typical projects — parse errors show immediately.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Start Dev Server

Start the development server on the specified port 
 Registers watch directories with Resource for change 
 detection Recompilation is handled by syncs that 
 react to Resource change events

**Arguments:** `$0` **port** (int), `$1` **watchDirs** (string[])

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Port is available?
- [ ] Specs and syncs directories exist?
- [ ] Initial compilation succeeds?

**Examples:**
*Start dev server*
```bash
copf dev --port 3000
```

### Step 2: Check Status

Check the current status of a development server session

**Arguments:** `$0` **session** (D)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Server is responsive?
- [ ] Last recompile was successful?

**Examples:**
*Check dev server status*
```bash
copf dev status
```

### Step 3: Stop Server

Stop a running development server session and 
 unregister watched resources

**Arguments:** `$0` **session** (D)

**Examples:**
*Stop dev server*
```bash
copf dev stop
```

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| start | `copf dev --port <port>` | Start dev server |
| status | `copf dev status` | Check if running |
| stop | `copf dev stop` | Stop the server |


## Validation

*Start dev server:*
```bash
npx tsx cli/src/index.ts dev --port 3000
```
*Check dev server status:*
```bash
npx tsx cli/src/index.ts dev status
```
