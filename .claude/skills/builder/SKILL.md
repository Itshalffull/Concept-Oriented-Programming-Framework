# Builder

Build concept **$ARGUMENTS** for the configured language targets, routing to the appropriate provider and storing content-addressed artifacts.


> **When to use:** Use when compiling, testing, and packaging concept implementations across languages. Coordinates build operations and routes to language-specific providers (SwiftBuilder, TypeScriptBuilder, RustBuilder, SolidityBuilder).


## Design Principles

- **Coordination, Not Compilation:** Builder coordinates — it never compiles directly. Language-specific provider concepts own compilation logic.
- **Content-Addressed Artifacts:** Build outputs are stored in Artifact with content-addressed hashes. Same inputs always produce same artifact.
- **Executor Transparency:** Builder doesn't know whether builds run locally, remotely, or in containers. Execution strategy is a provider-internal concern.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Build Concept

Compile, test, and package a concept implementation for a language and platform. Routes to language-specific providers.

**Arguments:** `$0` **concept** (string), `$1` **source** (string), `$2` **language** (string), `$3` **platform** (string), `$4` **config** (unknown)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Toolchain resolved for language+platform?
- [ ] Source directory exists and is non-empty?
- [ ] Config mode is valid (debug/release/skip-tests)?
- [ ] Artifact hash is content-addressed?

**Examples:**
*Build a concept*
```bash
copf build ./app.deploy.yaml --concept password --language swift
```
*Build all targets*
```bash
copf build ./app.deploy.yaml
```

### Step 2: Build All Targets

Build multiple concepts across multiple target languages and platforms in parallel.

**Arguments:** `$0` **concepts** (string[]), `$1` **source** (string), `$2` **targets** (unknown[]), `$3` **config** (unknown)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All target languages have resolved toolchains?
- [ ] Independent targets build in parallel?
- [ ] Partial results reported if some builds fail?

**Examples:**
*Build all concepts for all targets*
```bash
copf build ./app.deploy.yaml
```

### Step 3: Run Tests

Run tests only for a previously built concept — no recompilation.

**Arguments:** `$0` **concept** (string), `$1` **language** (string), `$2` **platform** (string), `$3` **testFilter** (string[]?), `$4` **testType** (string?), `$5` **toolName** (string?)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Build artifact exists for this concept+language?
- [ ] Test runner detected for language?

**Examples:**
*Run tests for a concept*
```bash
copf build test --concept password --language swift
```

### Step 4: Build Status

Check the current status of a build: pending, compiling, testing, packaging, done, or failed.

**Arguments:** `$0` **build** (B)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Build reference is valid?

### Step 5: Build History

Show build history for a concept, optionally filtered by language.

**Arguments:** `$0` **concept** (string), `$1` **language** (string?)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Language filter is valid (if provided)?

**Examples:**
*Show build history*
```bash
copf build history --concept password
```

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| build | `copf build` | Compile, test, package one concept |
| buildAll | `copf build` (all targets) | Build all concepts for all targets |
| test | `copf build test` | Run tests only (no compile) |
| status | `copf build status` | Check build status |
| history | `copf build history` | Show build history |


## Anti-Patterns

### Building without toolchain resolution
Calling Builder/build before Toolchain/resolve — compilation will fail.

**Bad:**
```
# Skip toolchain resolution
Builder/build(concept: "password", language: "swift", ...)

```

**Good:**
```
# Resolve first, then build
Toolchain/resolve(language: "swift", platform: "linux-arm64")
# -> ok(tool, version, path)
Builder/build(concept: "password", language: "swift", ...)

```

### Monolithic build action
Putting compilation, testing, and packaging logic in Builder instead of provider concepts.

**Bad:**
```
# Builder implementation knows about swiftc flags
if (language === "swift") { exec("swiftc -c release ..."); }

```

**Good:**
```
# Builder routes to SwiftBuilder which owns swift-specific logic
SwiftBuilder/build(source, toolchainPath, platform, config)

```
## Validation

*Build all targets:*
```bash
copf build ./app.deploy.yaml
```
*Build specific language:*
```bash
copf build ./app.deploy.yaml --language swift
```
*Dry run (show build plan):*
```bash
copf build ./app.deploy.yaml --plan
```
*Run tests only:*
```bash
copf build test --concept password --language swift
```
