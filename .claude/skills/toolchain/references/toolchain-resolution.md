# Toolchain Resolution

Toolchain resolves compilers for the build layer.

## Resolution Flow

1. Toolchain/resolve(language, platform, versionConstraint)
2. → Routes to language provider (SwiftToolchain, etc.)
3. Provider checks PATH, validates version, detects capabilities
4. Returns: tool ref, version, path, capability list

## Capabilities

Capabilities describe what a resolved tool supports:

| Language | Example Capabilities |
|----------|---------------------|
| Swift | macros, swift-testing, typed-throws, cross-compile |
| TypeScript | esm, cjs, declaration-maps, composite-projects |
| Rust | wasm-target, proc-macros, incremental |
| Solidity | optimizer, via-ir, foundry-tests, hardhat-tests |

## Validation

`validate(tool)` re-checks a previously resolved tool:
- File exists at recorded path
- Version matches what was resolved
- Not corrupted or partially uninstalled

Used before builds to catch environment drift without
full re-resolution.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `copf toolchain list` | Show all resolved toolchains |
| `copf toolchain resolve swift` | Resolve Swift toolchain |
| `copf toolchain validate` | Re-validate all toolchains |
