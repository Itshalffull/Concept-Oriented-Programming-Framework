# Walkthrough: Resolving Toolchains

This walkthrough shows how toolchain resolution works
for a multi-language build.

## Step 1: List Installed Toolchains

```bash
copf toolchain list
```
```
Language     Platform       Version   Path                  Status
swift        linux-arm64    5.10.1    /usr/bin/swiftc       ok
typescript   node-20        5.7.2     /usr/local/bin/tsc    ok
rust         linux-x86_64   1.78.0    /usr/local/bin/rustc  ok
solidity     evm-shanghai   0.8.25    /usr/local/bin/solc   ok
```

## Step 2: Resolve with Constraints

```bash
copf toolchain resolve swift --platform linux-arm64 --version ">=5.10"
```
```
Resolved: swift 5.10.1
Path: /usr/bin/swiftc
Capabilities: macros, swift-testing, cross-compile
```

## Step 3: Validate Before Build

```bash
copf toolchain validate
```

Checks all previously resolved toolchains are still
valid (exist at path, version unchanged).

## Capability-Based Decisions

Builder checks capabilities to determine build modes:
- "incremental" → enable incremental compilation
- "wasm-target" → WASM output available
- "cross-compile" → cross-platform builds supported
