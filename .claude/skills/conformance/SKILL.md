# Conformance

Verify that generated code faithfully implements concept 
 specifications Maintain spec to test traceability Track 
 per target conformance status Document and manage acceptable 
 deviations where a target language can t fully express a 
 spec requirement

## Commands

### generate
Parse concept spec and generate language independent 
 test vectors Each vector specifies an action invocation 
 and expected outcome based on the spec s operational 
 principle and invariants 
 Test vectors are language independent the same vector 
 is executed against the TypeScript , Rust , Swift , and 
 Solidity implementations

**Arguments:** `$0` **concept** (string), `$1` **specPath** (string)

### verify
Run conformance test vectors against a built artifact 
 for a specific language Returns which spec requirements 
 are covered by passing tests

**Arguments:** `$0` **suite** (C), `$1` **language** (string), `$2` **artifactLocation** (string)

### registerDeviation
Record an acceptable deviation Example : Solidity 
 can t express Option types the same way as Rust , 
 so the conformance test for optional return values 
 uses a different assertion shape

**Arguments:** `$0` **concept** (string), `$1` **language** (string), `$2` **requirement** (string), `$3` **reason** (string)

### matrix
Return cross target conformance matrix 
 Shows which concepts pass conformance for which 
 languages conformance values : full , partial , 
 failing , untested

**Arguments:** `$0` **concepts** (string[]?)

### traceability
Return full traceability : which spec requirements 
 are tested by which test vectors in which languages

**Arguments:** `$0` **concept** (string)
