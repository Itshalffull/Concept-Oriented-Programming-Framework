# ContractTest

Verify cross target interoperability for concepts that 
 generate code in multiple languages Maintain contract 
 definitions derived from concept specs Track which 
 producer consumer pairs have been verified Gate deployment 
 on contract verification passing

## Commands

### generate
Generate a contract definition from the concept spec 
 The contract captures the wire level interface : action 
 signatures , input output schemas , and expected variants 
 Language independent the same contract applies to 
 every target implementation

**Arguments:** `$0` **concept** (string), `$1` **specPath** (string)

### verify
Run contract verification : the consumer sends requests 
 to the producer and checks that responses match the 
 contract definition Tests serialization round trips , 
 variant handling , error propagation , and edge cases

**Arguments:** `$0` **contract** (P), `$1` **producerArtifact** (string), `$2` **producerLanguage** (string), `$3` **consumerArtifact** (string), `$4` **consumerLanguage** (string)

### matrix
Return cross target verification matrix 
 Shows which language pairs have been verified 
 for which concepts

**Arguments:** `$0` **concepts** (string[]?)

### canDeploy
Check if deploying this concept in this language is 
 safe all contract pairs involving this language have 
 been verified for the current spec version

**Arguments:** `$0` **concept** (string), `$1` **language** (string)
