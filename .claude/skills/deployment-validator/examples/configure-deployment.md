# Walkthrough: Configuring a Deployment

This walkthrough shows how to set up a deployment manifest
for a two-runtime application.

## The Application

- **API runtime**: User, Article, Comment concepts
- **Worker runtime**: Email, Notification concepts
- Syncs cross the boundary (e.g., WelcomeEmail)

## Step 1: Define Runtimes

```yaml
runtimes:
  api:
    type: node
    concepts: [User, Article, Comment]
    capabilities: [storage-postgres, transport-http]
  worker:
    type: node
    concepts: [Email, Notification]
    capabilities: [storage-redis, transport-amqp]
```

## Step 2: Assign Sync Engines

```yaml
engines:
  default:
    type: in-process
    syncs: [CreateProfile, UpdateCache]
  async:
    type: queue
    syncs: [WelcomeEmail, NotifyOnComment]
```

## Step 3: Configure Transport

```yaml
transports:
  api-to-worker:
    type: http
    from: api
    to: worker
    endpoint: http://worker:3001
```

## Step 4: Validate

```bash
copf deploy --validate deploy.yaml
```
