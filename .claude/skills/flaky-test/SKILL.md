# FlakyTest

Detect , track , and quarantine unreliable tests 
 Maintain per test reliability history across all 
 languages and builders Apply quarantine policies 
 so flaky tests don t block other developers 
 Notify owners Monitor for stabilization

## Commands

### record
Record a test result testType indicates which runner 
 produced the result ( e g , unit , e2e , integration ) 
 Updates reliability history per testId language testType 
 If the result differs from the previous result 
 ( pass to fail or fail to pass ) , increments flipCount

**Arguments:** `$0` **testId** (string), `$1` **language** (string), `$2` **builder** (string), `$3` **testType** (string), `$4` **passed** (bool), `$5` **duration** (int)

### quarantine
Manually quarantine a test Quarantined tests still 
 run but their failures don t block builds or deploys 
 Results are still recorded for monitoring

**Arguments:** `$0` **testId** (string), `$1` **reason** (string), `$2` **owner** (string?)

### release
Release a test from quarantine It will block builds 
 again if it fails Used when a flaky test is fixed

**Arguments:** `$0` **testId** (string)

### isQuarantined
Test is quarantined Callers should treat failures 
 as warnings , not errors

**Arguments:** `$0` **testId** (string)

### report
Return flaky test dashboard data If testType is 
 provided , only include tests of that type 
 stabilized : tests that were quarantined but have 
 been passing consistently ( candidates for release )

**Arguments:** `$0` **testType** (string?)

### setPolicy
Update flaky detection policy 
 flipThreshold : number of flips to trigger detection ( default : 3 ) 
 flipWindow : time window for flips ( default : 7d ) 
 autoQuarantine : automatically quarantine detected flaky tests ( default : false ) 
 retryCount : number of retries before declaring failure ( default : 1 )

**Arguments:** `$0` **flipThreshold** (int?), `$1` **flipWindow** (string?), `$2` **autoQuarantine** (bool?), `$3` **retryCount** (int?)
