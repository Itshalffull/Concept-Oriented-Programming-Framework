# Snapshot

Manage golden file baselines for generated output 
 Compare current generator output against approved 
 snapshots Detect unintended changes to generated 
 code structure , formatting , or content Support a 
 human in the loop approval workflow for intentional 
 changes

## Commands

### compare
Current output matches approved baseline exactly 
 Content hash identical No action needed

**Arguments:** `$0` **outputPath** (string), `$1` **currentContent** (string)

### approve
Current output becomes the new baseline 
 Records approval timestamp and optional approver 
 Future comparisons use this as the reference

**Arguments:** `$0` **path** (string), `$1` **approver** (string?)

### approveAll
Approve all pending changes , optionally filtered 
 by path prefix Used for bulk approval after 
 intentional generator changes

**Arguments:** `$0` **paths** (string[]?)

### reject
Mark the current change as rejected The output 
 should be reverted to match the baseline Signals 
 that the generator change was unintentional

**Arguments:** `$0` **path** (string)

### status
Return snapshot status for all tracked paths 
 Statuses : current , changed , new , rejected

**Arguments:** `$0` **paths** (string[]?)

### diff
Return detailed unified diff between baseline and 
 current output

**Arguments:** `$0` **path** (string)

### clean
Remove baselines for output files that no longer 
 exist ( orphaned snapshots from deleted concepts )

**Arguments:** `$0` **outputDir** (string)
