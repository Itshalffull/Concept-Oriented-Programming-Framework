# copf resource — Help

Track input resources for **<source>** with content-addressed digests and change classification.


> **When to use:** Use when tracking input files, detecting changes, or querying which resources are currently registered.


## Design Principles

- **Content-Addressed Tracking:** Resources are tracked by content digest, not modification time. Two files with identical content have the same digest.
**upsert:**
- [ ] Locator is a stable, unique identifier?
- [ ] Digest is a content hash (not a timestamp)?

**list:**
- [ ] Kind filter matches expected resource types?
## Quick Reference

| Action | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| upsert | `copf resource upsert` | Track or update an input |
| get | `copf resource get` | Look up a tracked resource |
| list | `copf resource list` | List all tracked inputs |
| remove | `copf resource remove` | Stop tracking a resource |
| diff | `copf resource diff` | Classify a content change |


## Validation

*List tracked resources:*
```bash
npx tsx tools/copf-cli/src/index.ts generate --status
```
