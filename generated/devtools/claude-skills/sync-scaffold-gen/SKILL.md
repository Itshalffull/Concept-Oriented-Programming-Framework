# SyncScaffoldGen

Scaffold a sync rule **$ARGUMENTS** with trigger patterns, guard conditions, and effect actions.


> **When to use:** Use when creating a new sync rule to connect concepts. Generates a .sync file with when/where/then clauses from trigger and effect configurations.


## Design Principles

- **Declarative Wiring:** Syncs declare what happens when — they never contain imperative logic, loops, or conditionals beyond pattern matching.
- **Concept Independence:** Syncs reference concepts by name but concepts never know about syncs. The sync is the only place where concept names appear together.
- **Pattern Completeness:** The when clause must match specific action completions (concept/action with variant). The then clause invokes specific actions.
- **Purpose Clause Quality:** Every sync must have a purpose clause that explains the causal chain — 'When X happens, do Y because Z'. Never just restate the sync name or omit the purpose entirely.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Register Generator

Self-register with PluginRegistry so KindSystem can track SyncConfig → SyncSpec transformations. Registration is also handled automatically by register-generator-kinds.sync.

**Examples:**
*Register the sync scaffold generator*
```typescript
const result = await syncScaffoldGenHandler.register({}, storage);
```

### Step 2: Preview Changes

Dry-run the generation using Emitter content-addressing to classify each output file as new, changed, or unchanged. No files are written.

**Arguments:** `$0` **name** (string), `$1` **trigger** (trigger), `$2` **effects** (effect[])

### Step 3: Generate Sync Rule

Generate a well formed sync file with when where then 
 clauses from the provided trigger and effect configurations

**Arguments:** `$0` **name** (string), `$1` **trigger** (trigger), `$2` **effects** (effect[])

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Sync name is PascalCase?
- [ ] Tier annotation matches intended behavior ([eager], [required], [recommended])?
- [ ] When clause references a valid concept/action?
- [ ] Variable bindings in where clause use ?prefix?
- [ ] Then clause references a valid concept/action?
- [ ] Purpose statement explains why the sync exists?
- [ ] All files written through Emitter (not directly to disk)?
- [ ] Source provenance attached to each file?
- [ ] Generation step recorded in GenerationPlan?

**Examples:**
*Generate a simple sync*
```bash
clef scaffold sync --name CreateProfile --from User/create --to Profile/init
```
*Generate an eager sync*
```bash
clef scaffold sync --name ValidateOrder --tier required --eager
```

## Quick Reference

| Input | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| name | String | PascalCase sync name |
| tier | String | Sync tier (required, recommended) |
| eager | Boolean | Fire immediately (default: true) |
| trigger | Trigger | When clause (concept, action, params, variant) |
| conditions | list Condition | Where clause guards |
| effects | list Effect | Then clause actions |


## Anti-Patterns

### Missing or restated purpose
Sync has no purpose clause, or the purpose just restates the sync name — readers can't understand why the sync exists.

**Bad:**
```
sync CreateProfile [eager]
when { ... }
then { Profile/create: [owner: ?u] }

```

**Good:**
```
sync CreateProfile [eager]
  purpose: "Initialize an empty profile automatically when a new user registers"
when { ... }
then { Profile/create: [owner: ?u] }

```

### Sync with imperative logic
Sync tries to express conditionals or loops instead of pattern matching.

**Bad:**
```
# Pseudo-code in sync — not valid!
if user.isAdmin then
  AdminPanel/grant: [user: ?u]

```

**Good:**
```
where {
  bind(?meta.role as ?role)
  any(?role = "admin")
}
then {
  AdminPanel/grant: [user: ?u]
}

```
## Validation

*Generate a sync scaffold:*
```bash
npx tsx cli/src/index.ts scaffold sync --name CreateProfile --from User/create --to Profile/init
```
*Validate generated sync:*
```bash
npx tsx cli/src/index.ts sync validate syncs/create-profile.sync
```
*Run scaffold generator tests:*
```bash
npx vitest run tests/scaffold-generators.test.ts
```
