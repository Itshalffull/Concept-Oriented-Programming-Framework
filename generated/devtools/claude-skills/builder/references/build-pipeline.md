# Build Pipeline Architecture

The build layer bridges generated source and deployable artifacts.

## Pipeline Flow

1. DeployPlan/execute — triggers build phase
2. Toolchain/resolve — find compiler for language+platform
3. Builder/build — compile, test, package (routed to provider)
4. Artifact/store — content-addressed artifact storage
5. Runtime/deploy — deploy the stored artifact

## Execution Strategies

Builder providers support three executor types configured in
the deploy manifest:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `local` | Invoke compiler directly on host |
| `remote` | Send source to remote build service |
| `container` | Run build in Docker container |

## Deploy Manifest Build Section

```yaml
build:
  targets:
    - language: swift
      platform: linux-arm64
      mode: release
      config:
        version: ">=5.10"
        package-format: framework

  executor:
    swift:
      type: remote
      endpoint: https://build.internal/swift
```

## DAG Integration

Build nodes insert before deploy nodes in the DAG:

```
resolve-toolchain → build-concept → store-artifact → deploy-concept
```

Independent language targets build in parallel. Toolchain
resolution happens once per language, shared across concepts.
