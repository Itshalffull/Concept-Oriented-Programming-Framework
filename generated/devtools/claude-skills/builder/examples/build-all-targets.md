# Walkthrough: Building All Targets

This walkthrough shows how to build a concept for multiple
language targets using the deploy manifest.

## Step 1: Configure Build Targets

```yaml
# app.deploy.yaml
build:
  targets:
    - language: swift
      platform: linux-arm64
      mode: release
      config:
        version: ">=5.10"
        package-format: framework

    - language: typescript
      platform: node-20
      mode: release
      config:
        version: ">=5.7"
        bundler: esbuild
        package-format: npm
```

## Step 2: Build

```bash
clef build ./app.deploy.yaml
```

The build layer:
1. Resolves toolchains (once per language)
2. Builds each concept for each target (in parallel)
3. Stores artifacts in content-addressed storage

## Step 3: Check Results

```bash
clef build history --concept password
```

## Executor Strategies

Configure how builds execute in the manifest:

```yaml
executor:
  swift:
    type: local        # Direct invocation
  typescript:
    type: container    # Docker-based
  rust:
    type: remote       # Remote build service
    endpoint: https://build.internal/rust
```
