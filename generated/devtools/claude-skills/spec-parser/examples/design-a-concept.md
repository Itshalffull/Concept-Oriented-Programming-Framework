# Walkthrough: Designing a Concept from Scratch

This walkthrough shows how to design a `Bookmark` concept
following Jackson's methodology.

## Step 1: Articulate the Purpose

> What is this concept for?

```
purpose { Allow users to save and organize references to items. }
```

- One sentence, imperative present tense.
- No implementation details (no "stores in database").

## Step 2: Design the State

Start from the purpose. A bookmark needs:
- A collection of bookmarks
- Which user owns it
- Which item it references
- Optional: a label

```
state {
  bookmarks: set B
  owner: B -> U
  item: B -> I
  label: B -> option String
  created: B -> String
}
```

## Step 3: Design the Actions

What can users do with bookmarks?

```
actions {
  action add(item: I, label: option String) {
    -> ok(bookmark: B) { Bookmark created. }
    -> duplicate(item: I) { Item already bookmarked. }
  }
  action remove(bookmark: B) {
    -> ok { Bookmark removed. }
    -> notFound(bookmark: B) { Bookmark does not exist. }
  }
  action list(owner: U) {
    -> ok(bookmarks: list B) { User's bookmarks returned. }
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Write Invariants

```
invariants {
  after add(item) -> ok(bookmark) {
    then { bookmark in bookmarks; item(bookmark) = item }
  }
  after remove(bookmark) -> ok {
    then { bookmark not in bookmarks }
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Validate

```bash
copf check specs/bookmark.concept
```
