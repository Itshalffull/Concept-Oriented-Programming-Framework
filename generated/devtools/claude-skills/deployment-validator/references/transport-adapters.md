# Transport Adapter Reference

Transport adapters enable cross-runtime communication when
concepts in different runtimes need to interact through syncs.

## Adapter Types

| Type | Use Case | Latency |
|------|----------|---------|
| `http` | REST-based communication | Medium |
| `websocket` | Bidirectional real-time | Low |
| `amqp` | Message queue (RabbitMQ) | Medium |
| `in-process` | Same runtime (no transport) | None |

## HTTP Adapter

```yaml
transports:
  api-to-worker:
    type: http
    from: api
    to: worker
    endpoint: http://worker:3001
    timeout: 5000
    retries: 3
```

## WebSocket Adapter

```yaml
transports:
  realtime:
    type: websocket
    from: api
    to: client
    path: /ws
```

## AMQP Adapter

```yaml
transports:
  async-bridge:
    type: amqp
    from: api
    to: worker
    url: amqp://rabbitmq:5672
    exchange: copf-events
    queue: worker-tasks
```

## When to Use Transports

- **Same runtime**: No transport needed. Syncs run in-process.
- **Two runtimes, same machine**: Use `http` or `in-process` IPC.
- **Distributed**: Use `amqp` for reliability or `websocket` for
  low-latency bidirectional communication.
