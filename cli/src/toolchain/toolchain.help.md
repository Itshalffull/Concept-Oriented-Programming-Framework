# clef toolchain — Help

Resolve toolchain for **<source>**, validating compiler availability, version constraints, and platform capabilities.


> **When to use:** Use when resolving, validating, or listing compiler toolchains for the build layer. Routes resolution to language-specific providers (SwiftToolchain, TypeScriptToolchain, RustToolchain, SolidityToolchain).


## Design Principles

- **Resolution Caching:** Resolve once per language+platform, reuse across all concept builds. Toolchain resolution is shared.
- **Drift Detection:** Validate before build to catch environment drift — tools may be uninstalled, upgraded, or moved between resolves.
- **Provider Routing:** Toolchain never knows about swiftc, tsc, or rustc — it routes to SwiftToolchain, TypeScriptToolchain, etc.
**resolve:**
- [ ] Language is supported (swift/typescript/rust/solidity)?
- [ ] Platform identifier is valid?
- [ ] Version constraint parseable?
- [ ] Provider registered for this language?

**validate:**
- [ ] Tool reference is valid?
- [ ] Tool still exists at recorded path?
- [ ] Version hasn't changed since resolution?

**list:**
- [ ] Language filter is valid (if provided)?

**capabilities:**
- [ ] Tool reference is valid?

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| resolve | `clef toolchain resolve <lang>` | Find compiler for language |
| validate | `clef toolchain validate` | Re-check resolved tools |
| list | `clef toolchain list` | Show all toolchains |
| capabilities | `clef toolchain capabilities` | Show tool capabilities |


## Anti-Patterns

### Hardcoded tool paths
Builder uses hardcoded paths to compilers instead of resolving through Toolchain.

**Bad:**
```
SwiftBuilder/build(toolchainPath: "/usr/bin/swiftc", ...)

```

**Good:**
```
Toolchain/resolve(language: "swift", platform: "linux-arm64")
# -> ok(tool, version, path: "/usr/bin/swiftc", capabilities)
SwiftBuilder/build(toolchainPath: ?path, ...)

```
## Validation

*List resolved toolchains:*
```bash
clef toolchain list
```
*Resolve a specific toolchain:*
```bash
clef toolchain resolve swift --platform linux-arm64 --version '>=5.10'
```
*Validate all toolchains:*
```bash
clef toolchain validate
```
